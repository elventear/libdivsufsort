-- INSTALL for libdivsufsort

Compilation and Installation:
-----------------------------

   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
those values to create a `Makefile' in each directory in the
libdivsufsort source tree. Finally, it creates a shell script
`config.status' that you can run in the future to recreate the
current configuration, and a file `config.log' containing compiler
output (useful mainly for debugging `configure').

   The file `configure.ac' is used to create `configure' by a program
called `autoconf'.  You only need `configure.ac' if you want to change
it or regenerate `configure' using a newer version of `autoconf'.

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.  If you're
     using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type
     `sh ./configure' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute
     `configure' itself.

     Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. Type `make install' to install the library and header files.

  4. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.


Compilers and Options:
----------------------

   Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking
that the `configure' script does not know about. You can give
`configure' initial values for configuration parameters by setting
variables in the command line or in the environment.  Here
is an example:

     ./configure CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix

Run `./configure --help' for details on some of the pertinent
environment variables.
